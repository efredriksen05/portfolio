# Portfolio

## Overview
Welcome to my portfolio!

I’m a 20-year-old Computer Science student with a passion for building projects that combine creativity and problem-solving.  

Here, you’ll find a collection of my work, ranging from personal experiments to academic projects, all reflecting my interest in web development and user-centered design.

## Technologies
This portfolio was built using a modern front-end stack:

- **React** – for creating a dynamic and component-based user interface  
- **TypeScript** – to add type safety and improve code quality  
- **Tailwind CSS** – for fast, responsive, and utility-first styling  
- **Vite** – as a lightning-fast build tool and development environment
